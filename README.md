Caffeine-ng
===========

Caffeine is a little daemon that sits in you systray, and prevents the
screensaver from showing up, or the systems from going to sleep.
It does so when an application is fullscreened (eg: youtube), or when you click
on the systray icon (which you can do, when, eg: reading).

This is a fork of [Caffeine 2.4](http://launchpad.net/caffeine/), since later
versions dropped support for the systray icon in favour of only automatic
detection of fullscreen apps only, which resulted rather
[controversial](https://bugs.launchpad.net/caffeine/+bug/1321750).

The intention of this fork is to also evolve on its own, not only fixing
issues, but also implemented missing features, when relevant.

Caffeine-ng was shortly know as Taurine, a play on its successor's name, since
taurine is a known stimulant, commonly found in energy drinks.  However, this
name did not last, since the artwork would not match adequately, and changing
it was undesirable.

Hacking
-------

To run: ```./bin/caffeine```
To compile translations: ```./update_translations```

If you want to test out a translation without changing the language for the
whole session: "LANG=ru_RU.UTF-8 ./bin/caffeine" (Replace ru_RU.UTF-8
with whatever language you want to use. You will need to a language pack
for the specific language) Be aware that some stock items
will not be translated unless you log in with a given language.
